# 🩺 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

This project predicts individual medical insurance costs using a **Linear Regression** model trained on health and demographic features such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to estimate the **medical insurance charges** based on user data.  
A **Linear Regression** model was implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm Used:** Linear Regression  
- **Target Variable:** Insurance Charges  
- **Features Used:** age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region  
- **Dataset Source:** Medical Insurance dataset (commonly available on Kaggle)

## 📈 Model Performance

| Metric | Value |
|:-------|------:|
| **R² Score** | **0.79** |

*(Replace 0.79 with your actual R² value.)*

The model explains approximately **79% of the variance** in medical charges, showing a good fit for a simple linear model.

## 🧩 Future Improvements

- Try **Polynomial Regression** or **Random Forest Regressor** to improve prediction accuracy  
- Add **hyperparameter tuning** and **cross-validation**  
- Include **visualizations** for feature importance and residual errors
